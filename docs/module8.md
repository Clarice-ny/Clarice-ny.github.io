# MODULE 8
## 🌐 ESP32 Wi-Fi & Cloud Communication Report

## 🔧 Goal
Connect ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network and send data to a cloud endpoint such as ThingSpeak, Firebase, or a test server.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- ESP32 Dev Module  
- Arduino IDE  
- Wi-Fi credentials  
- Optional: ThingSpeak or any cloud URL

---

## 📡 Wi-Fi Setup
The ESP32 was configured to connect to a local Wi-Fi network using SSID and password. Connection status and IP address were monitored via the Serial Monitor.

---

## ☁️ Cloud Communication
Once connected to Wi-Fi, the ESP32 attempted to send data to the cloud using HTTP POST. Response codes from the server confirmed successful communication.

---

## ✅ Results
- Successfully connected ESP32 to Wi-Fi  
- Sent data to a remote cloud endpoint  
- Confirmed communication via HTTP responses

---

## 📌 Summary
- Practiced connecting ESP32 to a network  
- Explored cloud communication via HTTP  
- Ready for integration with real-time sensor data and dashboards
