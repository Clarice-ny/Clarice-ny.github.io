## MODULE 9
# üì∑ ESP32-CAM Programming Report

## üéØ Objective
To set up and program the ESP32-CAM module using the Arduino IDE and test its camera functionality.

---

## üß∞ Components
- ESP32-CAM module (AI-Thinker)  
- FTDI USB-to-Serial adapter (3.3V)  
- Jumper wires  
- Arduino IDE

## üîå Wiring for Programming

| ESP32-CAM | FTDI Adapter |
|-----------|--------------|
| GND       | GND          |
| 5V        | VCC (5V)     |
| U0R       | TX           |
| U0T       | RX           |
| GPIO 0    | GND (for flashing) |

> Note: GPIO 0 must be connected to GND during upload and disconnected afterward to run.
