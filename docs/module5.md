# MODULE 5
## 🔌 1. Introduction
I explored basic components like sensors, actuators, switches, and buttons, using both Arduino and Raspberry Pi Pico.

## 🧠 2. Sensors vs. Actuators
Sensors detect changes (e.g. temperature, light).

Actuators perform actions (e.g. LED, motor).
Sensors are inputs; actuators are outputs.

## 🔘 3. Switches & Buttons
Used to control digital pins (HIGH/LOW).
Often require pull-up resistors.
Helpful for user input (e.g. turning LEDs on/off).

## 💡 4. Blinking an External LED
Connected LED + resistor to a GPIO pin.
Used digitalWrite() to turn it on/off in a loop.
Simple way to learn output control.

## 🎚️ 5. Analog Inputs
Read variable signals using analogRead().

Tested with a potentiometer.

Values range from 0–1023 (Arduino) or 0–65535 (Pico in MicroPython).

## 🤖 6. Tools & Platforms
Arduino IDE for C++
Thonny IDE for MicroPython
Pico uses 3.3V logic, Arduino uses 5V

## ✅ Key Takeaways
Learned to wire and program basic I/O.
Understood how microcontrollers sense and act.
Practiced analog and digital interfacing.
